# API-Gateway & API-Manager tools

This repository contains a number of tools, that might be helpful for instance to do infrastructure and middleware testing, load testing etc. Right now, it's just a start. It is intended to be a place to collect more.

## API-Manager load test - working with large amounts of platform users
[MassLoadUsersApps](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-mgr-testing-tools/tree/master/MassLoadUsersApps) - 
A tool to create a big number of users plus applications. This is useful to validate the API-Management platform can handle many users and apps.

## Independen PKI to issue infrastructure (test) certificates
[InfrastructureTestCA](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-mgr-testing-tools/tree/master/InfrastructureTestCA) - Shell script for creating an independen, three layer PKI that can be used for end-to-end tests on non-production middleware.

## Automatic Setup of an API-Managwer Test System
[AutoSetupApiMgrSystem](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/api-gw-mgr-testing-tools/tree/master/AutoSetupApiMgrSystem) - Scripting approach of installing and auto-configuring a API-Manager system based on a complete, independent API-Gateway topology. Idea is to create an on-demand test-system.
